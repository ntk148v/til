Source: <https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-warehouse-vs-data-lake-vs-data-lakehouse>

Data warehouses, data lakes and data lakehouses are different types of data management solutions with different functions:

- Data warehouses aggregate, clean and prepare data so it can be used for business intelligence (BI) and data analytics efforts.
- Data lakes store large amounts of raw data at a low cost.
- Data lakehouses combine the flexible data storage of a lake and the high-performance analytics capabilities of a warehouse into one solution.
