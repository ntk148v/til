## 1. Methododologies

### 1.1. Terminology

|               |                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IOPS          | Input/output operations per second - the rate of data transfer operations                                                                                       |
| Throughput    | The rate of work performed -> the data rate (bytes per second or bits per second)                                                                               |
| Response time | The time for an operation to complete (time spent waiting + time spent being serviced (service time))                                                           |
| Latency       | A measure of time an operation spends waiting to be serviced.                                                                                                   |
| Utilization   | A measure of how busy a resource is, based on how much time in a given interval it was actively performing work(time-based or capacity-based)                   |
| Saturation    | The degree to which a resource has queued work it cannot service                                                                                                |
| Bottleneck    | A resource that limits the performance of the system                                                                                                            |
| Workload      | The input to the system or the load applied                                                                                                                     |
| Cache         | A fast storage area that can duplicate or buffer a limited amount of data, to avoid communicating directly with a slower tier of storage -> improve performance |

### 1.2. Concepts

- Trade-offs:
  - Good/Fast/Cheap "pick two".
  - Common trade-off:
    - CPU and memory, memory can be used to cache results, reducing CPU usage.
    - Network buffer size: small buffer sizes -> reduce the memory overhead/connection; large size -> improve network throughput.
- Tuning efforts: Performance tuning is most effective when done closest to where the work is performed.

| Layer        | Example Tuning Targets                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application  | Application logic, request queue sizes, database queries performed |
| Database     | Database table layout, indexes, buffering                          |
| System calls | Memory-mapped or read/write, sync or async I/O flags               |
| File system  | Record size, cache size, file system tunables, journaling          |
| Storage      | RAID level, number and type of disks, storage tunables             |

- Different organizations and environments have different requirements for performance. You may have joined an organization where it is the norm to analyze much deeper than youâ€™ve seen before, or even knew was possible
- When to stop analysis:
  - When you're explained the bulk of the performance problem.
  - When the potential ROI is less than the cost of analysis.
  - When there are bigger ROIs elsewhere.
- Performance recommendations, especially the values of tunable parameters, are valid only at a specific _point in time_.
- Problems of load vs. architecture.
- Scalability:
  - The performance of a system as its load increases.
  - knee-point, saturation point
- Common types of system performance metrics:
  - Throughput: Either operations or data volume per second
  - IOPS: I/O operations per second
  - Utilization: How busy a resource is, as a percentage
  - Latency: Operation time, as an average or percentile
- Profiling builds a picture of a target that can be studied and understood.
- Caching is frequently used to improve performance.
  - hit ratio

### 1.3. Perspective

- Two common perspectives for performance analysis:
  - _workload analysis_
  - _resource analysis_
